    "Most data science projects will start with a bunch of notebooks. However, at some point we will want to reuse code between them, and eventually put our models in production without the need to use the notebooks themselves ([unless you are Netflix](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/notebook-innovation-591ee3221233)). Choosing a good project layout is extremely important to organize the code, avoid common pitfalls and be predictable (i.e. imitate the rest of the ecosystem to minimize surprise). On the other hand, there is lots (**lots**) of outdated, bad or wrong advice on the Internet about this topic, so here we will present The Objective Truth™.\n",

A typical example will be development dependencies: we will need things like pytest and black, but we don't want the user to install them as part as our library. To do that, we can specify *groups* of optional dependencies under the `tool.flit.metadata.requires-extra` section:\n",
