    "Bootstrapping a working Python installation in a future-proof way can be tough. Linux distributions carry a ([sometimes crippled](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/4222#issuecomment-417646535)) Python _that should **never** be used for development_, macOS does the same thing with even older version, and in the case of Windows configuring the `%PATH%` is considerably error prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, even with a correct Python installation (let's assume Python >= 3.6 for sanity), the native [environment creation utility](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) has two problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It's tied to the originating Python version (e.g. if I install Python 3.6, I can't create a Python 3.8 environment)\n",
    "2. For packages that require compiled extensions (mostly scientific/data packages, but not only), sometimes admin intervention is needed to install some system dependency\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three popular solutions for these problems nowadays:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/) to manage Python environments. It solves (1) by allowing several Python versions, and doesn't handle (2). The main advantage is that several Python interpreters can be installed seamlessly. _Does not have official support for Windows_\n",
    "* Use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/). It solves (1) and (2) by giving you _an entire operating system_, which is a bit overkill, and some people claim [it's optimized for deployment, not development](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/7198#issuecomment-230965019). The main advantage is its total flexibility.\n",
    "* **Use [conda](https://conda.io/)**. It solves (1) and (2) by providing a somewhat language-agnostic package and environment manager that does not require admin privileges. We will use this solution, even though it requires some care when mixing it with pip and its performance is (at the time of writing) not very good."
